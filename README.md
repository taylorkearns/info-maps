# Info Maps

This app has two features:

* [Info Section](http://info-maps.herokuapp.com/regions/): regional maps with country/state info available on click. Hooked a DB up and 
use ActiveAdmin so that admin can create and pull up relevant info on that country.

* [Game Section](http://info-maps.herokuapp.com/games/1/): quiz for testing geography knowledge.

This app uses Winston Wolf's beautiful [CSS maps](http://winstonwolf.pl/clickable-maps/europe.html)
and just attaches a database for the info section a some JS for the game section.
